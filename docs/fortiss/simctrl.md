# How to drive on a map using simctrl

## Default Sunnyvale with two offices map

1. Load map in the upper right corner of dreamview
2. Launch Simctl
3. Launch "Routing", "Planning" and "Control" in Module Controller Tab
4. Send a routing request in the Route Editing Tab
=> Vehicle is moving in the simulation


## Using a Custom Map
1. Load the map and reload it
2. Make sure to specify a valid start pose: 
   1. There are parameters for that in sim control: fortiss_simcontrol_set_start_pose, fortiss_simcontrol_start_x, fortiss_simcontrol_start_y
   2. Set these in the flagfile:  /apollo/modules/common/data/global_flagfile.txt
3. Launch Simcontrol (vehicle will jump to the specified start pose)
4. Launch "Routing", "Planning" and "Control" in Module Controller Tab
5. Send a routing request in the Route Editing Tab or select default route in the lower left corner of the Tasks tab
=> Vehicle is moving in the simulation


##  Good to know

### If the Routing Tab is not available: 
- switch to sunnyvale map
- reload dreamview
- tab is here
- switch back to guerickestraÃŸe map

## Errors

### Errors that probably do nor yield a problem
- E0830 15:00:42.363376 22508 map_service.cc:371]  Unable to get paths from routing! -> is this a problem?
- E0830 14:57:17.676298 22507 map_service.cc:495]  Failed to find lane: 4 -> is this a problem?

### Problematic errors
- Only one or two lane segments are visualized in dreamview -> only a visualization issue! I can drive the last few meters on the map, but the map is not visualized!
- I cannot initially load a custom map, have to switch to a sunnyvale map and back. why?
